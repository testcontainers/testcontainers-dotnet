# Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores data for lightning fast search, fineâ€‘tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.

Add the following dependency to your project file:

```shell title="NuGet"
dotnet add package Testcontainers.Elasticsearch
```

You can start an Elasticsearch container instance from any .NET application. This example uses xUnit.net's `IAsyncLifetime` interface to manage the lifecycle of the container. The container is started in the `InitializeAsync` method before the test method runs, ensuring that the environment is ready for testing. After the test completes, the container is removed in the `DisposeAsync` method.

=== "Usage Example"
    ```csharp
    --8<-- "tests/Testcontainers.Elasticsearch.Tests/ElasticsearchContainerTest.cs:UseElasticsearchContainer"
    ```

The test example uses the following NuGet dependencies:

=== "Package References"
    ```xml
    --8<-- "tests/Testcontainers.Elasticsearch.Tests/Testcontainers.Elasticsearch.Tests.csproj:PackageReferences"
    ```

To execute the tests, use the command `dotnet test` from a terminal.

## A Note To Developers

The Testcontainers module creates a container that listens to requests over **HTTPS**. To communicate with the Elasticsearch instance, developers must create a `ElasticsearchClientSettings` instance and set the `ServerCertificateValidationCallback` delegate to `CertificateValidations.AllowAll`. Failing to do so will result in a communication failure as the .NET will reject the certificate coming from the container.
